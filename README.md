# YourPapyrs

<h2> Project Description </h2>
YourPapyrs.com is a redefinition of what social media is. Instead of traditional social media which creates a superficial image of what our lives are like. YourPapyrs.com is meant to show true human connection through poetry.
The project is built using a MERN stack, meaning it uses MongoDB for the database, Express for the routing, React for the frontend, and NodeJS for the backend.
Making sure the environment for sharing poems was safe and free of hate speech was incredibly, so we implmented a flag system, where users can flag a piece which will then be reviewed.
A future implementation will be a dashboard where users can see all their liked pieces and their published pieces.

<h2> How to Use </h2>
To use the project, simply go to www.yourpapyrs.com. You can create an account to get access to all the features of the program. Once you signup, a verification email will be sent to you which will allow you to activate your account.
Once activated you will be redirected to the home page. From there you can upload a piece, look at published pieces, like, and flag pieces.
